Computational MRI provides a deeper look into computational and machine learning methods 
for the inverse problem of MRI data acquisition and image reconstruction.  
The course is given by Florian Knoll https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/florian-knoll

Topics
---
Topics covered will include but are not limited to:  
· Recap of MR signal and encoding, Fourier imaging  
· Introduction to the inverse problem of imaging  
· Partial Fourier imaging (Hermitian, Margosian, POCS)  
· Non Cartesian (Radial-trajectory)  
· Parallel imaging (SENSE, GRAPPA)  
· Non-Cartesian Imaging and Iterative Reconstruction (NUFFT-toolbox,Conjungated Gradient)  
· Compressed sensing  
· Machine Learning in MRI

The effect of each method is shown in report and ''result'' folders.
